proxyeditor
===========

Proxyeditor is a Chrome plugin that allows users to create local editable copies of js/css files using html5 Filesytem API, 
and ACE code editor. This plugin is very raw, but the idea is to be able to navigate to a page, select particular js or
css files, and then have the files open up in an in-browser editor for development.
